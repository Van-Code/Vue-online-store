# Vue online store
A little online store, complete with product list, add to cart, create account, sign in, ability to add multiple shipping addresses and to choose a default. I plan to add the ability to add multiple credit cards, a search feature, and improve overall look and feel as well as responsive styling. https://van-code.github.io/Vue-online-store/#/
